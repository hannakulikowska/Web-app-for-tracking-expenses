# EXPENSEE - a web application for tracking expenses

Requirements are received for a new web application to be developed named Expensee. You can find them in a __requirements.md__ file.

A __checklist.md__ file is created with test scenarios covering the requirements for testing the web application in advance.

Test scenarios are designed relying on my own experience and understanding of the system.
